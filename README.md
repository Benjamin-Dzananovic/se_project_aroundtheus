# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Around the US

The project name is Around the US

This project is the basis for a more in depth interactive page the users can add and remove photos,like photos of others and create their own profiles.

This project involves us creating an interface that will appear correct across multiple devices and resolutions. It involved us acquiring necessary information from Figma instead of project description packets.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
